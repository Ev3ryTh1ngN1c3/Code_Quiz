# Code_Quiz
A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.
The motivation for this project is to complete a coding assessment to prepare for an interview process.
This project was built as an interactive coding challenge.
The problem solved is to take a timed quiz on coding fundamentals.
I learned a gauge of my progress.
I worked through challenges with syntax errors & unresponsivness.
Front End Technologies used are HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
